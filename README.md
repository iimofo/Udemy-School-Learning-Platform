## üîß Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone and Install Dependencies

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd folder
npm install
```

### 2. Firebase Setup

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Create a new project
3. Enable Authentication with Google Sign-in
4. Create a Firestore database
5. Enable Storage
6. Get your Firebase configuration

### 3. Configure Firebase

1. Open `src/config/firebase.js`
2. Replace the placeholder values with your actual Firebase configuration:

```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "your-actual-api-key",
  authDomain: "your-project.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "your-project-id",
  storageBucket: "your-project.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "your-sender-id",
  appId: "your-app-id"
};
```

### 4. Firestore Security Rules

Set up your Firestore security rules:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Users can read their own data
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    // Students can read courses and lessons
    match /courses/{courseId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && 
        get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role in ['teacher', 'admin'];
    }
    
    match /courses/{courseId}/lessons/{lessonId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && 
        get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role in ['teacher', 'admin'];
    }
    
    // Enrollments
    match /enrollments/{enrollmentId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

### 5. Storage Rules

Set up your Firebase Storage rules:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /{allPaths=**} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && 
        firestore.get(/databases/(default)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role in ['teacher', 'admin'];
    }
  }
}
```

### 6. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

## üÜò Support

If you encounter any issues or have questions, please open an issue in the repository.

## üîí Security

This project uses environment variables to keep sensitive information secure. Never commit your `.env` file to version control. The `.env.example` file serves as a template for required environment variables.

### Environment Variables Setup

1. Copy the example environment file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Edit `.env` with your Firebase credentials:
   ```env
   VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project_id.firebaseapp.com
   VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
   VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project_id.appspot.com
   VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id_here
   VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id_here
   VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_measurement_id_here
   ```

3. Update `src/config/firebase.js` to use environment variables:
   ```javascript
   const firebaseConfig = {
     apiKey: import.meta.env.VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY,
     authDomain: import.meta.env.VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN,
     projectId: import.meta.env.VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID,
     storageBucket: import.meta.env.VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET,
     messagingSenderId: import.meta.env.VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID,
     appId: import.meta.env.VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID,
     measurementId: import.meta.env.VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID
   };
   ```
